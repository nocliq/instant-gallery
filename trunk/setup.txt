   1. Installation
   2. Configuration
   


1. Installation

1.1 Unpack the files, and copy them to your server, for example to /home/youruser/public_html/instant-gallery/

1.2 The folder "portfolio" is where you should create your directories and throw your images in it. The PHP script will take care of creating a navigation tab for each folder from the folder name, so keep that in mind when naming your folders.

../instant-gallery/portfolio
		- /catg x
		- /catg y
		- /catg z


2. Configuration

2.1. Image thumbnails are generated into the "cache" folder(duh!). You can configure the thumbnails proportions in index.php

define( 'THUMBNAIL_IMAGE_MAX_WIDTH', 160 );
define( 'THUMBNAIL_IMAGE_MAX_HEIGHT', 104 );

2.2 Unless stated otherwise 'portfolio/default' is the default folder for your projects. You can alter this behaviour by modifying the $catg variable of index.php to a folder of your choice.
